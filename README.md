Show your all results and screenshots of your running programs in HW10.pdf.

Your submission (studentnumber_hw10.zip) should include the following files anddate.txt, screenshots of your running programs step by step with explanations as a HW10.pdf file, output_even_LiknedList.txt and output_even_dynamicarray.txt,HW10_&lt;student_name&gt;_&lt;studentSurname&gt;_&lt;student number&gt;_answer.c“//” you put comment line before each question in your source code
